# Car-Classification

### Description :

* <p align = "justify">Built a model which is designed to classify the cars into seven categories that is Audi, Hyundai Creta, Mahindra Scorpio, Rolls Royce, Maruti Suzuki Swift, Tata Safari and Toyota Innova.</p>

* <p align = "justify">Here, the input image of the car is given to the model and the model classifies it among the seven categories and displays the result to the users.</p>

### Requirements :

* Numpy
* Gradio
* TensorFlow
* Matplotlib

### Methodology :

* <p align = "justify">This system is built using the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying the cars on the image that is given as the input. The accuracy of the model is increased by increasing the number of epochs that is given to the model.</p>

* <p align = "justify">ImageDataGenerator is used here so that the model will become more robust as it trains on images that are slightly distorted and it helps to prevent the model from learning noise in the data such as where features are located in the image.</p>

* <p align = "justify">This model is trained and tested on a set of image data of the seven category of cars and are used to classify the cars into its categories of the unseen image data that are given by the users.</p>
